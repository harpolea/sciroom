There's a couple of things I hope someone can help me with, and a couple of theories of my own. 
Firstly, if the vast majority of the universe is made of dark matter then does dark matter co-exist alongside visible matter? And if so, is it possible that gravity is an effect caused soley by the dark element and not visible matter? Could this explain why quantum mechanics that describes visible matter can never be reconciled with gravity?
Secondly are the Red Shift of light from distant galaxies and background microwave radiation the only two pieces evidence that the universe is expanding and accelerating? If so, then could a foam-like structure that was decaying cause the same effects? ie if light was travelling across the membrane between bubbles at the moment the membrane bursts, then instead of the light travelling across the diameter it would be thrown out to the circumference causing it to be stretched. This would not require dark energy just a natural process of decay. Bursting bubbles may emit microwave radiation. There could even be regions where nearly all the bubbles had burst and this would be observed as ""gaps"" in the BMR.""",,Astrophysicist should answer.

Then there's a more correct, but still partial answer that gravitational forces are due to curvature in space-time, and objects aren't pulled anywhere, but when no other forces are in play follow straight paths through curved space. OT: Disagrees with this definition a little. JK will ask Paul Gow or Simon Redfearn. AH: Anything with mass bends spacetime, nothing is pulling anything.
